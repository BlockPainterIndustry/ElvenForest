## About The Project
This the repository for the New Elven Forest Mod

## Getting Started
### Download
The mod is work in progres. The first two alpha-versions are uploaded on [curseforge](coming soon) 
You can of course download the dev branch build as a .jar but there is not much you could do especially in survival.

### Build it your self
1. Install Intellij
2. Pull the latest Source of the 'dev' branch
3. In Intellij create new Project from existing Source
4. Build.gradle should install automatically when not run build.gradle
5. Optional: Run the runData task in gradle. 
6. Build Project

## Future Plans

First Alpha Version: The mod will reach the first alpha Version (Version: alpha-0.1.0). Version alpha-0.1.0 will also be the first version I will release. (alpha-0.1.0 uploaded)

You can find the roadmap on [curseforge](coming soon). This is only a roughly plan for the alpha version.


## Warning

Please Understand that all versions with alpha or beta in name could be unstable and or game breaking especially the versions uploaded on the dev branch. I will try to keep all versions in master aswell as the uploaded mods on the mod portal as clean and bug free as possible but understand that at this point I coding the mod alone and to this in my free time.

This is also only a small hobby. When i want to work on this mod I will to it when not then not.
